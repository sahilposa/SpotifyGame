We used Flask-Login for the Signup and Login pages and UserMixin to authenticate and allow login_required condition. In our app, the user should be able to signup, then redirected to login to his/her account. Once logged in, he/she can view their profile page along with the scores of all the games played till now. The buttons with the option to start game or logout of app are present below the scoreboard. Once the user clicks on start game, he/she will be redirected to choose genre page, where he/she can choose the genre from the dropdown menu and submit it to the server. Then, the click of Play Game takes him to the React page where he will be able to hear the songs of his choosen genre and can start guessing. The current score of the user will be 0 and the timer shows the time elapsed. The guessed song name should be entered in the field provided and will be able to continue guessing. The score changes according to the guessed answer and the points can increase or decrease accordingly. Bonus points will also be awarded if the correct name is guessed within certain amount of time. Once, the song is guessed the user can see the current score increasing if the guess is right. The user has the chance to View their ranking by clicking on that button which redirects them to a new leaderboard page with the scores of all games played by all the users of the app. The buttons to change genre or log out of the game are also available at then end. Hope everyone enjoys our game!
